VERY IMPORTANT:  
**Access the Application**:
   - To get the localhost port number, you have to run the application.  At the end of the process, it will tell you what port you are running on.
     For example:Application is running on port 51967

In the application.properties file, you will see that i am using port 0. Port 0 allows the user to find any avaiable port to use when the usual 8080 or 8081 is not available.  I found this to be a very usual fact that I wish I had known sooner.
